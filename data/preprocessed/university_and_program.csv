(more information can be found here).  The core emphasis of NUS LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE is excellence in design—we imbue our students with a deep understanding of the dual nature of design as both a process and a product. As a process, we prioritize landscape design to be creative, but one which is grounded in socio-cultural sensitivities, ecological knowledge, and grasp of conventional and emergent technologies and techniques. Design as a process benefits from synergistic knowledge exchange among multiple disciplines in NUS as one of the top research intensive universities in Asia and the world. As a product, landscape design expressed through various visual and digital media, must be inspiring, move the heart, and above all, instigate meaningful and impactful landscape changes in real life. The programme is distinctively Asian and pantropical in its geographic attention and urban in its emphasis. With our central location in one of the most dynamic, diverse and rapidly urbanizing regions of the world, we aim to provide a landscape architecture education that is sensitive to the myriad challenges facing Asian cities, as well as opportunities provided by the sheer richness of heritage and cultural, socio-economic and ecological elements of the region. Our location in Singapore, with its diversity of culture and cosmopolitan outlook, and where greening and ecology of the built environment is a cornerstone of its urban development approach, also provides an enriching backdrop to our training of landscape architects.

Bachelor of Social Sciences (Anthropology) at National University of Singapore (NUS) ,"The National University of Singapore aspires to be a vital community of academics, researchers, staff, students and alumni working together in a spirit of innovation and enterprise for a better world. Our singular focus on talent will be the cornerstone of a truly great university that is dedicated to quality education, influential research and visionary enterprise, in service of country and society.","Anthropology is the study of what makes us human.  It considers the range of human diversity, accounting for how people in different times and places have developed distinctly different societies. It exposes us to a vast variety of different beliefs and health practices, economic and political systems, material culture, and even different notions of beauty, the environment, food, family … and the good life.  How do we account for such diversity? Do we even experience pain, happiness, and love the same way in every society? How are climate change, racism, and inequality understood and dealt with in different societies?  Together, these and a litany of other questions invite us to explore the variations and commonalities of the human experience.  In the process, anthropology overturns our common-sense views of the world and opens our eyes to the possibilities of human existence. Anthropology is much sought after for the sort of training it offers its students – a ground up approach to developing deep understanding on just about every aspect of the human condition.   The conceptual tools it offers, and the sensibilities it engenders, make us particularly attuned to the complexities of life on the ground.  It equips us with analytical and methodological skills to carefully observe and interpret human behaviour holistically.  Ethnography, as a hallmark of anthropology’s distinctive approach to studying human societies, offers intimate views of social life as they happen and how they are linked to the larger forces and global systems to which they may be connected.  The application of anthropological theory to understand cultural behaviour and the ethnographic method to study contemporary social issues and problems allow us to better understand and deal with the chaos, uncertainty, and ambiguity that characterise the contemporary age.","Anthropology graduates have entered a variety of professions including market and social research and policy formulation; research companies and audit consultancies; advertising and sales; health and social work; business and finance; civil service; journalism and mass-media; non-governmental organisations; arts and events management; and conservation, museum and heritage management."
